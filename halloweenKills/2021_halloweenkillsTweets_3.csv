⭐️⭐️⭐️

Haunt is a great bit of fun for horror fans. The killers are truly creepy and the kills are brutal. It takes ideas from The Saw franchise with the haunted house ‘gone wrong’ setups. Add this to your Halloween viewing for a haunting time. https://t.co/e1Ihr3c5p5",2021-04-23 20:20:20+00:00,,0,0,1,0
